Sample Backend creation using Node Js, Sequelize, and MySQL 

1. Basic

# Install mysql client for Node Js 
npm install mysql2

# Installing Sequelize ORM 
npm install sequelize

# Sequelize automatically runs the Db and tries to connect with it
# Model in sequelize helps us to create the table and set the data inside it for example rows and column
# Sequelize is similar to mongoose 

2. MySQL specific things - 

# Check the mysql service status 
sudo service mysql status 

# Enter as a root user in mysql -> 
sudo mysql

# Command to exit the mysql -> 
exit

# Command to get the list of the user in mysql 
Select user from mysql.user

# Sample user created for this project - 
abhishek
123 

# Command to Create a user 
CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

# Grant all permission to the specific user 
grant all privileges on *.* to 'abhishek'@'localhost' with grant option;

# Entering into mysql using the created user / specific user 
mysql -u abhishek -p

# Check who is the current logged user 
select current_user;

# Creating a specific Database 
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
